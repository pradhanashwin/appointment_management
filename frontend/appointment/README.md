## Installation

To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
- NPM or Yarn package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:pradhanashwin/appointment_management.git
   cd appointment_management/frontend/appointment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using NPM:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:8000/api` with your backend API URL.

## Development

To start the development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Accessing from the Network

To expose the development server on your local network, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application:

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the built files:**

   You can use a static server like `serve` to serve the files:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve -s dist
   ```

3. **Deploy to your production server:**

   Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your production server and serve it using your preferred method (e.g., Nginx, Apache).

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL`: The base URL of the backend API.

Make sure to update these variables in the `.env` file or provide them directly in your CI/CD pipeline or hosting environment.
