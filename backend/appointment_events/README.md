## Poetry

This project uses Poetry for dependency management.

To run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
cd /appointment_management/backend/appointment_events/
poetry install
poetry run python -m appointment_events
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find Swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

Read more about Poetry here: [https://python-poetry.org/](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Database Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up the PostgreSQL database:

1. **Create the database:**

   If you have PostgreSQL installed locally, you can create the database manually using the following commands:

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   CREATE DATABASE appointment_events;
   CREATE USER appointment_events WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE appointment_events TO appointment_events;
   ```

2. **Alternatively, use Docker to start a PostgreSQL instance:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=appointment_events" -e "POSTGRES_USER=appointment_events" -e "POSTGRES_DB=appointment_events" postgres:16.3-bullseye
   ```

Ensure that the database settings in your environment variables or `.env` file match the above credentials.

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory or rename
`example.env` to `.env` and place all
environment variables here

All environment variables should start with the `APPOINTMENT_EVENTS_` prefix.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
APPOINTMENT_EVENTS_RELOAD="True"
APPOINTMENT_EVENTS_PORT="8000"
APPOINTMENT_EVENTS_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

Read more about the `BaseSettings` class here: [https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/)

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit hooks, run the following inside your shell:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit is configured using the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and runs the following by default:

- `black` (formats your code)
- `mypy` (validates types)
- `ruff` (spots possible bugs)

## Migrations

To manage your database migrations, use Alembic.

### Running Migrations

To apply all migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

To upgrade to a specific migration:

```bash
alembic upgrade <revision_id>
```

### Reverting Migrations

To revert migrations:

```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>  # Revert to a specific revision
alembic downgrade base           # Revert all migrations
```

### Generating Migrations

To generate migrations:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate  # For automatic change detection
alembic revision                 # For an empty migration file
```

## Running Tests

To run tests:

1. **Start the database:**

   If using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=appointment_events" -e "POSTGRES_USER=appointment_events" -e "POSTGRES_DB=appointment_events" postgres:16.3-bullseye
   ```

2. **Run tests locally:**

   ```bash
   pytest -vv .
   ```

   To run tests in Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
   docker-compose down
   ```

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## TODO

1. **Setup Docker for easier deployment:** 
   - Create Dockerfiles and configurations to ensure a smooth deployment process.

2. **Add event scheduling feature:**
   - Implement event scheduling using RabbitMQ, long-polling, or WebSocket to manage real-time updates and notifications.

3. **Add event conflict management:**
   - Develop logic to handle conflicts between events, ensuring that overlapping appointments are managed appropriately.

4. **Add user management and access control:**

   - Implement a user management system and secure access from the frontend using JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
